Visual insights for parameter fitting on SVR 
_______________________________
We present a visual approach for parameter tuning on SVM predictors. We base our approach on a visual technique that helps the user visualizing the effects of choosing different values for a collection of parameters for SVM estimators. Given a fixed subset of parameters, which we call the pivot parameter set, the user can choose a range of values for another given parameter to fit, denoted as the playing parameter. For each possible configuration according to such a range of values, Easy Visual Fitting processes the training and validation of a correspondent set of SVM estimators, and plots multiple measures and computed metrics on an intuitive set of charts and tables for the user to rank the best model in terms of performance, scalability and generalization strength. The user can easily change the playing parameter at each time, and also the value of any of the pivot parameters at any time, and the whole report reflects changes immediately after the back-end ML processing. We aim to provide a DataViz instrument capable of giving non-expert users intuitive insights for a well-done parameter fitting on SVM estimators in terms of both process scalability and intuitiveness.
